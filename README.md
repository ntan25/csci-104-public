# CSCI 104 Assignment List 
- PA 1: Multi-dimensional Linked-List Implementation for Tagging Emails
- PA 2: Simple Search Engine, tasks involved were simple parsing, set searching, set finding, set mapping
- PA 3: Informed Search (A*) to solve a car puzzle game, computing heuristics, implementing A* search, creation of the Heap structure to identify the best move, trivial sample implementation of a stack. 
- PA 4: AVL and Binary Search Tree 
- PA 5: Recursion and Counting, Wordle Engine given "known" (green) and "floating" (yellow) letters as well as a recursively-defined program to schedule workers so as to not violate certain constraints availability and shift hours. 
- PA 6: Hashmap implementation involving a probabilistic hash function, doubly hashed probing sequence. The map was used in a recursively defined program to determine if two graphs are isomorphic given an adjacency list
